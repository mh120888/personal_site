What I love

This is my dog; I call him Poli, which is short for Napoleon (I actually wasn't the one who named him).  He is a 4 year old chihuahua/minpin mix and is extremely active, sometimes obnoxiously so.  I've had him since May 2009, and as you can see he was once about as tall as a can of soda.  Now he's all grown up, weighing in at a massive 6 lbs, and spends most of his time eating, playing fetch, and sleeping.  DBC will be the longest period of time that I've spent without him trying to steal my warm spot on the sofa.

Quirky Facts

I couldn't think of anything quirky about myself that seemed worth bringing up, however when going through some pictures of myself I remembered that (according to other people)I make a lot of strange faces.  According to one friend, I suffer from RBS - go <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/brandon-gorrell/2012/07/the-overthinkers-guide-to-resting-bitchface-syndrome/">here</a> to learn more about what that is if you don't already know.

If you ever want to know what I am thinking, watch my face!
